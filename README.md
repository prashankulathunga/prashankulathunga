# Well, hello there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?

I'm a passionate Computer Science student at the University of Plymouth with a deep love for technology and innovation. I'm particularly fascinated by AI applications and full-stack development, always eager to explore cutting-edge technologies and build solutions that make a difference.

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and continuous learning. Whether it's through code, collaboration, or conversation, I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and contribute to the tech community.

Since I'm actively building my skills as a developer, I love to share my projects and code so others can learn from them and build upon them.
